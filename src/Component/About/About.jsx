              I am Manan Loshali, a proud resident of "Devbhoomi" Uttarakhand,
              and I have recently completed my B.Tech in Computer Science
              Engineering from Uttarakhand Technical University. Throughout my
              academic journey, I have been a self-learner, constantly expanding
              my knowledge and skills beyond the classroom.

              I initially focused on Front-End Web Development, but my passion
              for technology and learning has driven me to broaden my expertise.
              Today, I am a Full Stack Web Developer with hands-on experience in
              both front-end and back-end technologies.

            During my internship at 75way Technologies, I contributed to the
            development and maintenance of two live web applications using
            ReactJS and VueJS, ensuring high performance and responsiveness. I
            implemented robust backend solutions with Node.js and MongoDB,
            enhancing data management and server-side functionality. I also
            utilized Material UI and SCSS to create visually appealing and
            user-friendly interfaces, which significantly improved the overall
            user experience. Additionally, I integrated Next.js to optimize
            application performance and implement server-side rendering,
            resulting in faster load times and improved SEO.

            improvements and best practices. I developed various web pages using
            Next.js and ReactJS, closely collaborating with the UI design team
            to enhance the user interface. Working alongside Senior Engineers, I
            helped build customized software products for consumers. I also had
            the opportunity to attend meetings that delved into emerging
            technologies like Web3, blockchain, and NFTs.
